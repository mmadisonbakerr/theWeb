PART 1: Solidify Terminology
- What is HTTP?
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (standard web) 
    (How browsers and servers communicate)
- What is a URL?    
    (uniform resource locator)
- What is DNS?
     (domain name system) turns a hostname into an IP address
- What is a query string?
    optional but provides “extra information” and goes at the end 
    of the url
- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    GET (requests without side effects) and POST (requests with side
    effects)
- What is an HTTP request?
    information that is sent to a server
    in a request you specify a method, http protocal version (1.1), 
    the resource url, and a header(not mandatory)
- What is an HTTP response? 
    the server sends information back in http form
    in a response you get http protocal version (1.1), a response 
    status code, headers, and response bodies (the content of the page)
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and 
response headers you have seen.
    a type of request 
    Accept-Language - shows the web page in a different natural 
    language (fr is french)
    Accept - shows you a different coding language
- What are the processes that happen when you type 
“http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    the browser turns the name into an ip address, the browser then makes 
    a request to the ip address using headers, then it sends a response, the 
    browser then makes a DOM from the html and adds any other resources, 
    then it makes an http request and receives a response from the server.
